# Cuboid-Calculator
A Python program that can determine the area, volume, and diagonal of a cuboid with width, length, and height given by the user.
Use the following formulas:
𝐴 = 2(𝑙𝑤 + 𝑙ℎ + 𝑤ℎ)       ----> Area
𝑉 = 𝑙𝑤ℎ                   ----> Volume
𝐷 = (l^2 + w^2 + h^2)^1/2 ----> Space diagonal of the cuboid
